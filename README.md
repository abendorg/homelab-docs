\# Keith's Homelab Documentation



Welcome to the official documentation hub for my multi-phase homelab build.  

This project is designed to be public, transparent, and contributor-friendly.



\## Purpose



This repository documents the full evolution of my homelab across \*\*multiple phases\*\*, from digital identity and DNS foundations to full self-hosting, monitoring, automation, and beyond.



Each phase is isolated, structured, and (hopefully) professionally written to help others follow along or adapt the concepts to their own environments.



\## Structure



\- `docs/` — All documentation content

\- `phases/` — Each homelab phase in its own folder

\- `shared/` — Diagrams, templates, docker-compose files, and reusable resources

\- `about/` — Philosophy, methodology, and security fundamentals

\- `mkdocs.yml` — Site configuration for MkDocs Material

\- `.github/workflows/` — GitHub Pages deployment pipeline



\## Viewing the Documentation



Once deployed, the site will be available at: https://github.com/abendorg/homelab-docs/
