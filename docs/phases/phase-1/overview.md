# Phase 1 Overview — Digital Foundation

Phase 1 establishes the digital identity and online infrastructure that your entire homelab will rely on. Before touching hardware, you will configure:

- A domain name  
- Cloudflare DNS  
- Professional email  
- SMTP relay for applications  
- DMARC monitoring  
- Network-wide DNS filtering  
- A curated IT news feed  
- A basic external web host  

This phase uses only free-tier services and emphasizes security, especially MFA.

> “If you take only one thing away from this section, let it be this: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not optional.”

Every account created in this phase holds keys to your digital kingdom. Enable MFA immediately after creating each account.
