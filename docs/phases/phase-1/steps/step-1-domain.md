# Step 1: Get Your Free Domain Name

Your domain name is the foundation of your digital identity. It becomes the anchor for email, DNS, services, and future homelab components.

## What You’re Doing
You will register a **free subdomain** using the FreeDomain project on GitHub.  
This gives you a real, publicly accessible domain without cost.

## Why This Matters
- Provides a stable identity for your homelab  
- Enables custom email addresses  
- Allows you to configure DNS, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and more  
- Lets you host services under a professional-looking domain  

## Actions

### 1. Create a GitHub Account
If you don’t already have one, create a GitHub account.  
Immediately enable MFA using an authenticator app or YubiKey.

### 2. Register Your Free Domain
1. Visit the FreeDomain project  
2. Log in with GitHub  
3. Register a subdomain such as:
your-cool-lab.qzz.io

You can experiment with other domains later.

## Key Reminder
MFA is mandatory. Every service in this phase must be secured before moving on.
